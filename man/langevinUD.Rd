\title{Obtaining UD estimate of an animal using Langevin movement model}
\usage{
langevinUD(locs, times, ID = NULL, grad_array, with_speed = TRUE,
  alpha = 0.95, leverage = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{locs}{Matrix of locations having size, say, n}

\item{times}{Vector of observation times, must be of length n}

\item{ID}{Vector of track identifiers, must be of length n}

\item{grad_array}{Array of gradients of covariates, evaluated at
the locations of the observations, must be 3d array of dim(n, 2, J)
where J is the amount of covariates}

\item{with_speed}{Logical. If TRUE, the speed parameter is estimated
Other wise it is set to one}

\item{alpha}{Confidence level (default: 0.95, i.e. 95\% confidence intervals)}

\item{leverage}{Logical. If TRUE, the standardized residuals and the leverage
are returned. Default: FALSE. Might not work when there are many observations,
because it creates an n times n matrix.}
}
\value{
A list of: est, the vector of estimates, and var, the
covariance matrix of the estimates.
